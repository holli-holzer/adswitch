Quickly change or mute your playback devices in Windows

I have a USB headset. Windows switches the sound from speakers to an old-fashioned Headset once it is plugged in. A USB headset however has to be activated by right-clicking the speaker icon in the tray and then selecting Playback Devices - Headset - OK. That's 4 clicks and various mouse movements.

ADSwitch makes that easier. It adds an Icon to the system tray. When clicked it mutes/unmutes the current playback device. When double-clicked it cycles trough the available playback devices. When right-clicked, you can access the context menu.

There's a video showing these features:
